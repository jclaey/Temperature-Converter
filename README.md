This is a simple web app that converts temperatures from one unit to another.
You can convert fahrenheit, celsius, or kelvin to either of the other two units.
Just enter a temperature (whole number, no floating point numbers), select the original unit of measurement, select the new unit of measurement, and click the "convert" button.
The result displays below the form.
The entire form must be completed. If no temperature is given, HTML form validation will prompt you to fill it in, as it is set to "required". If both units of measurement are the same, JavaScript validation will trigger an error message that's then displayed above the form.
